  The Fixed Allocator:

  The fixed allocator performs equivalent function to malloc and free, however
  it only allocates blocks of a given size. It internally maintains a freelist
  which is essentially a linked list, where each free block points to the next
  block that is free, with a pointer in the first word of each block.

  Due to the free list implementation, we require that the size is bigger than the
  size of a pointer.

  faInitialize:

  Initialize sets up the allocator to have a certain size block, and
  a certain number of blocks. The free list is set up, and a pointer to the
  allocator is returned.
