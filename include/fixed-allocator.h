/**
  The Fixed Allocator:

  @brief The fixed allocator performs equivalent function to malloc and free,
  however it only allocates blocks of a given size.

  It internally maintains a freelist,  which is essentially a linked list,
  where each free block points to the next
  block that is free, with a pointer in the first word of each block.

  Due to the free list implementation, we require that the size is bigger than
  the size of a pointer.

  @brief fa_initialize sets up the allocator to have a certain size block, and
  a certain number of blocks.

  The free list is set up, and a pointer to the allocator is returned.

  @param numBlocks - number of blocks this allocator holds
  @param memory - raw memory on which to build the allocator, must be
